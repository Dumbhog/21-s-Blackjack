Welcome to my first coding project in a command line! A game of blackjack/21's (It can be either game at this stage)

Current Issues: 1. The first game runs the proceeding code perfectly, but after you play for a second time the program simply responds with "Let's play!" correctly but the code does not continue onwards and the game asks would you like to play agian.

Future features to add: Betting (Tokens, Doubling Down, high scores, running out of tokens)
