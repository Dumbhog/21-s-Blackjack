Welcome to my first coding project using a terminal/command line! A game of blackjack! You can implement this python code into a game or do what you want! (But pls credit)

Version V3.0 update: Added chips and betting! You can choose what you bet, if you win you get double your bet,
if you lose you lose your bet, and if both you the dealer stand on the same value (a push), you get your bet back.

Current Bugs: Unknown

Controls:
Agree to play: Y
Stand: E
Draw a card: Enter key
Inputting values: Type the integer into the terminal/command line

Future features to add: Aces valued at either 1 or 11
