Welcome to my first coding project using a terminal/command line! A game of blackjack! You can implement this python code into a game or do what you want! (But pls credit)

Version V5.0 update: 
- Added Doubling down, you can now double your bet but only after your second card! 
- You can now only stand after you've drawn 2 cards.

Current Bugs: Unknown

Controls:
Agree to play: Y
Stand: E (after drawing more than 2 cards)
Draw a card: Enter
Double Down: D (after drawing a total of 2 cards)
Quit: !Y
Inputting values: Type the integer into the terminal/command line

Future features to add: Splitting Pairs..?
